                Mark Elliot Zuckerberg (born May 14, 1984) is an American media magnate, internet entrepreneur, and
                philanthropist. He is known for co-founding Facebook, Inc. and serves as its chairman, chief executive
                officer, and
                controlling shareholder.
                On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched Facebook from his Harvard dormitory room.[38][39] An earlier
                inspiration for
                Facebook may have come from Phillips Exeter Academy, the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in
                2002. It
                published its own student directory, "The Photo Address Book", which students referred to as "The
                Facebook".
                Such photo
                directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools. With them,
                students were
                able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and their telephone numbers.[38]
